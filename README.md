# React Challenge: To-Do List

## Project Description

The "React Challenge: To-Do List" is my first challenge in the ReactJS track of Ignite, a specialization and development bootcamp. In this challenge, I reinforced all the most important ReactJS concepts and learned additional concepts on my own. The challenge required me to have autonomy in researching additional concepts as it went beyond the scope of the module.
